## Question I

100 sum is an O(N) function, since it processes two values per pass, making it
perform N/2 operations. 

## Question II 

This algorithm is also O(N) where N is the total number of elements in both
arrays. We could also express this as O(N + M). 

## Question III 

We run this algorithm for the entire needle every time we process a new element
in the haystack, so this has O(n*m) time complexity where N is the number of
elements in the needle and M is the number of elements in the haystack. 

## Question IV 

This algorithm runs in O(N^3) time.

## Question V

This algorithm eliminates half the resumes with each pass, so it runs in O(log
N) time.
