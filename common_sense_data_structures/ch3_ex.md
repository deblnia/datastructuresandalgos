## Question I. 

This is O(1), since the number of operations doesn't grow with the size of the input. 

## Question II. 

This is O(N) since we have a loop. 


## Question III. 

The time complexity of this function is O(log N) since placed_grains doubles every time the loop runs. 

## Question IV. 

This is also O(N). 

## Question V.

This splits the array in half at each step, so the time complexity is O(1) since the algo takes a fixed number of steps no matter what N is.
