Question I. 
(A) Reading takes one operation.
(B) Searching for a value not contained in the array takes N operations where N is the legnth of the array. 
(C) Insertion at the beginning of the array takes N+1 operations, since we have to shift every element of the array to the right and then insert the value. 
(D) Insertion at the end of the array takes one operation since the compiler keeps track of the length of the array, so can just insert at the next memory address. 
(E) Deletion at the beginning of the array takes N operations since the deletion is one operation, and then all the other elements of the array (N-1) need to be shifted left. 
(F) Deletion at the end of an array takes one operation.
