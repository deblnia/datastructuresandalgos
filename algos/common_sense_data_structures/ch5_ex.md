## Question I. 

An algorithm that takes 4N + 16 steps runs in O(N) time. 

## Question II.
 
An algorithm that takes 2N^2 time complexity is said to be O(N^2). 

## Question III. 

The given function runs in O(N) time. 

## Question IV. 

This runs in O(N) time since each of the string functions are O(1). They take 3
steps, but that's a constant so not counted.  

## Question V.

I think this is O(N^2). We skip the inner loop half the time but that just adds
a constant (1/2) to the time that isn't counted in the overall time.
