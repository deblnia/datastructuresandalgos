## Question I. 
 
It would take 4 steps to linearly search for the number 8 in the ordered array [2,4,6,8,10.12,13]. 


## Question II. 

Binary searching that array would take one step, since we'd start at the midpoint which happens to be 8. 

## Question III.   

The maximum number of steps to binary search an array of size 100,000 is between 16 and 17. You can divide 100,000 by 2 until you hit one, or you can log 100,000.
